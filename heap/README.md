# Priority Queue & Heap

### Queue vs Priority Queue

- Queue: First In First Out
- Priority Queue: Higher priority Faster Out

**Priority Queue** in usually emplemented by **heap**.

### What is Heap?
Heap is a datatype that is made for priority queue.
It is able to search min/max value fast in heap.

***Min Heap, Max Heap***
- Min Heap: Parent node has **smaller or same value** compared to its childs.
- Max Heap: Parent node has **larger or same value** compared to its childs.

Heap has another advantage in terms of time complexity, insertion and deletion.
