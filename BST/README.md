# Binary Search Tree (BST)

**Binary Search Tree** is a kind of datatype that combined 'binary search' and 'linked list'.

Nodes have no duplicated key each other.

Left subtree of root node has **smaller** value than its root node's key.<br>
Right subtree of root node has **bigger** value than its root node's key.<br>
And both subtree, left and right, have to be BST.

Traversal in BST is faster than normal binary tree.
It has O(logN) time complexity.
